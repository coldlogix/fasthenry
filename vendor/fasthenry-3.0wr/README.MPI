Using MPI feature of Fasthenry

Under Fedora 22:

install openmpi (dnf openmpi openmpi-devel)

module load mpi/openmpi

then just run the make in src/fasthenry folder and it autoselects the MPI built

run the program in paralell, e.g. in examples folder

mpiexec -n 4 ../fasthenry 30pin.inp

Please be aware there is a limitation running it distributed:
It assumes same architecture, (processor types / endiness / compiler settings / memory aligment / ...)
