The build:

Type "make all" in this directory.  This will build the fasthenry and
zbuf programs, and install the binaries in ./bin.  You can move or
copy the binaries to another location, such as /usr/local/bin, by hand
if desired.

The old config and Makefiles are still around -- DON'T USE THEM.  The
present source files and default Makefiles will work on any known
reasonably modern system that is vaguely Unix-like, including OS X,
Cygwin and MinGW, and of course Linux/*BSD.  If you have trouble
please report to stevew@wrcad.com.
